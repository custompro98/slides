# [custompro98's Slides](https://custompro98.github.io/slides/)

## Why does this repo exist?
- A repo to store compiled slides
- An online viewer for anyone who doesn't want to set up vim/reveal.js

## Why are there so many commits?
This came directly from the reveal.js repo in my dotfiles. Adding the new remote seemed like the simplest way to get a slides landing page.

### How do I add to this?
1. Add this repo as a remote called slides to reveal.js from my dotfiles
2. Generate presentations to a subdirectory in presentations
3. Push to slides master AND slides gh-pages
